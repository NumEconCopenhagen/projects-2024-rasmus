    "# Principal-Agent Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Principal-Agent model addresses scenarios where one party (the principal) hires another (the agent) to perform a task. The principal cannot observe the agent's effort directly but can see the outcomes, which are influenced by the agentâ€™s effort. The key challenge is designing a contract that aligns the agent's actions with the principal's interests despite the information asymmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model explores how contracts can be designed to align the interests of the principal and the agent. It is applicable in employment relationships, contracting scenarios, and any situation where work is delegated under conditions of asymmetric information. This assignment will apply the Principal-Agent model to an insurance context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent's Utility Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is a consumer whose utility depends on consumption (c) through the function $v(c)$. Consumption depends on income $M$. The agent has a probability $\\pi$ of needing their insurance. If the agent needs their insurance, they incur a loss $L$, and their consumption would be:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = M - L\n",

    "With probability $1 - \\pi$, the agent does not need their insurance:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = M\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principal's Payoff Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal in this case is an insurance company, which sells an insurance policy at a price $\\Gamma$ and offers a payment $K$ when the insurance is claimed. The consumer first pays $\\Gamma$, hence we can express the consumption probabilities for the principal as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "With probability $\\pi$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = M - \\Gamma - L + K\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With probability $1 - \\pi$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = M - \\Gamma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal offers the contract to the agent with the given $K$ and $\\Gamma$. The agent must achieve a higher utility from accepting the contract than their reservation utility, which is given as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{v} = \\pi \\cdot v(M - L) + (1 - \\pi) \\cdot v(M)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is assumed to be risk-averse and the insurance company is profit-maximizing. Therefore, the principal solves:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\Gamma, K} \\pi \\cdot (\\Gamma - K) + (1 - \\pi) \\cdot \\Gamma\n",
