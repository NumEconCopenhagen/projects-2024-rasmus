This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Yahoo finance**  and show that how the data can be used to price options using the Black-Scholes model.
3. Model project. We model the principal agent problem, where we calculate price discrimination, and extend the model by implementing more consumers.
4. Exam project.
